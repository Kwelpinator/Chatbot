## Question Generation

Some of the questions are generated by AI ([ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)) to help me get more questions related to the answer without having to work on them manually. You can try using this prompt to generate your question with AI:

```
Generate 20 relevant questions and answers on a specific topic. Ensure that the questions are related to the given topic and exclude unrelated queries. Provide a JSON body with the long version of the question and then provide a new code block with the short version separately. The topic must be clearly stated and should guide the generation of questions and answers. Please format your response according to the provided question and answer columns. If you fails to generate a dataset of 20 questions and answers, please include as many as possible.

Topic: <name the topic>

JSON:
<Provide the JSON body here>
